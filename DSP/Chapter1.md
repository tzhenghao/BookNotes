Feature abstraction and feature matching

Operating radar depends on: 1. noise in receiver 2. energy in initial pulse

Increasing energy will make the pulse longer, and longer pulses will affect accuracy and precision :(

Computed tomography

DSP for:
	1. Edge detection
	2. Brightness and contrast adjustment
	3. Noise reduction
	4. Focus adjustment
Motion blur reduction
